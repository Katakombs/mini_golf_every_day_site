## How to Use

### For Public Visitors
1. Visit `/blog.html` to read published posts
2. Click "Read More" on any post to view full content
3. Navigate through pages using pagination
4. No login required

### For Content Creators/Admins
1. Visit `/blog-admin.html` to access admin interface
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Use TinyMCE editor to create rich content posts
4. Manage posts, users, and site content
5. Public cannot access admin functionality

## Testing
Both interfaces have been tested and are working correctly:
- Public blog loads published posts without authentication
- Individual post viewing works with public API endpoint
- Admin interface maintains full functionality
- Complete separation achieved - no admin UI visible on public blog

## Next Steps
