# Python Version and SQLAlchemy Compatibility Decision

## Issue
Python 3.13 has compatibility issues with SQLAlchemy 2.0.23, causing the production server to crash with:
```
AssertionError: Class <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.elements.SQLCoreOperations'> directly inherits TypingOnly but has additional attributes
```

## Solution
- **SQLAlchemy Version**: Use `SQLAlchemy==2.0.41` which is compatible with Python 3.13
- **Requirements File**: Updated `requirements_blog.txt` to use the compatible version
- **Production Impact**: This prevents the server crashes that occurred before

## Why This Happened
- Python 3.13 introduced changes to typing that broke older SQLAlchemy versions
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.41 was specifically built to handle Python 3.13 compatibility
- The older version (2.0.23) was causing production server failures

## Prevention
- Always test with the exact Python version used in production
- Keep SQLAlchemy version pinned to a known working version
- Monitor for compatibility issues when upgrading Python or SQLAlchemy

## Current Working Configuration
- Python: 3.13.2
- SQLAlchemy: 2.0.41
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: 3.1.1

This configuration has been tested and works both locally and in production.
